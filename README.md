# WP Health (Formerly My WordPress Health Check)
This WordPress plugin monitors the health and security of your WordPress site! WP Health will check your WordPress installation to ensure that it is healthy, up to date, and secure. Use the WP Health page to quickly see the results of these checks using the simple color-coded sections.

Feel free to browse the code and make suggestions/requests. Thanks!

## Getting Started
We do not currently use any build scripts. This repo can be downloaded as a zip and installed as-is as a WordPress plugin.

Once installed, there will be a new **WP Health** page added to the Tools menu and heart icon to your admin bar if the results of these checks need attention.
