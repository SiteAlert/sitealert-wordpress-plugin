== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why do I need an uptime monitor? =
If your site were to go down right now, how many visitors and customers would you miss out on until you discovered your site was down? With uptime monitoring, you are immediately notified when your site goes down so you can look into and keep track of how often your site goes down.

Also, if your host guarantees 99% uptime, that could still mean 35 hours where your site is down each year. At 99.9%, that's still over 3 hours your site is down each year. Making sure your hosting provider is staying within their guarantee is important.

= How does your broken link checker work? =
You may have come across many plugins that can scan for broken links or broken images. However, most of these run the scan from your server which uses up a lot of our server's resources. In fact, many of these plugins are banned on several managed hosting providers.

Instead, all of our broken link and broken image scanners run on our servers and scan over your site. Not only does this prevent your server from being strained, this also allows SiteAlert to catch some links that are created within plugins, such as form builders, that broken link checker plugins would miss.
